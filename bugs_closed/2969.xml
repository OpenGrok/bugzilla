            <thetext>While you can force an analyzer for some files using the -A option, that configuration is not taken into account when xrefing the sourcecode itself.

I used -A hxx:org.opensolaris.opengrok.analysis.c.CAnalyzerFactory and did use -e to save diskspace here, but the hxx files e.g. in include statements are not treated properly (file.hxx for example is only treated as file.h)

Some of the hxx files are linked completely (those that are part of a path like dir/file.hxx), so it seems to me as if the -A option is not taken into account properly. As the -A options don&apos;t appear in the configuration.xml at all, this problem might only occur when not generating the HTML files while indexing.</thetext>

            <thetext>Now I&apos;m sure: It is not the indexing part.

I compiled opengrok from source and modified
src/org/opensolaris/opengrok/analysis/c/CAnalyzerFactory.java
and
src/org/opensolaris/opengrok/analysis/c/CXref.lex

to include hxx and did use it with the same index/configuration/data that was created with the binary distribution and the hxx files are now linked as expected.

So please make the analyzer-commandline configuration persistent so that the xref generation can benefit from those hints as well.

I reduce prio and severity since it is trivial to just modify the sources directly and recompile...</thetext>
