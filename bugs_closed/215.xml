            <thetext>Steps to reproduce:

1) go to src.opensolaris.org
2) select caiman as a project
3) full search for &quot;test&quot; to obtain some results
4) click one of the results to obtain the directory listing
6) click the very-top-level xref to see listing of all projects
7) descend to the czosug project
8) search for &quot;martin&quot; and limit search to the &quot;czosug&quot; directory
9) pres search, the result will be:

Your search +full:martin +path:czosug +project:caiman did not match any files. 

Expected behavior:

+project is dropped from the search query as soon as you leave the project boundary via xref traversal</thetext>

            <thetext>This was fixed 21-Aug-2007 in revision 123 of the repository. http://src.opensolaris.org/source is not running the latest version of opengrok.

The current problem is that the search is not limited to _just_ the specified directories, but also to include all sub-directories.</thetext>

            <thetext>Trond ... (also talking about 172 &amp; 107)
I think we should get project variable out to URL ... this would save a lot of problems with this regard ... (also solve this bug ;) )

I don&apos;t know why we hide it, but I see no problem having it in URL as it will be more complaint with the rest of opengrok implementation, hmm?</thetext>

            <thetext>Adding the project to the URL would do the trick, but that would require all xref&apos;s to be updated. Unfortunately we don&apos;t create an AST from the parsers, but render the file instead (so we need to add this logic in all of the xref&apos;ers)

When I first added the feature I was not sure how I wanted the feature to work, so I just added it to a cookie so it would be easy to change it later on ;-)</thetext>
