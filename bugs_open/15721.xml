- happens with 0.9 rc1 too

because of problem parsing changeset 3055 above files (and all touched with 3055 it seems) don&apos;t have the whole history ...</thetext>

            <thetext>bug 2966 didn&apos;t fix this issue
as the matter of fact it&apos;s still there, because we don&apos;t do per file hg history (performance reasons)

a solution that can be implemented is a workaround of hg lack of proper logs for hg rename:

use different template - we need:
added:
deleted:
files

than observe if there is the same file name in added and deleted (most probably this would be a rename, but it doesn&apos;t have to be 100% :( )

according to above guess one can then continue adding the history to the renamed file in processStream parser - note that for diffs to work properly you&apos;d need to generate different file name since the changeset that did rename in value of the radio button when you generate history page</thetext>

Really, Mercurial&apos;s lack of rename data combined with the way how history index is generated (&apos;hg log -v&apos; in top directory of the repo) only gives us single possibility - to provide an incomplete hack to guess if a file was renamed or not.

It would be nice if the history view for a renamed file can contain a warning that the history log is incomplete but that too is not possible without the additional query(ies) (comparing &apos;hg log&apos; and &apos;hg log -f&apos; for that file).

The OpenGrok documentation should probably mention this limitation.</thetext>
