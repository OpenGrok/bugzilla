Hi

I really am not a bad googler, but I could not find any tips on how to
search for a wildcard in a sentence. Specifically, we have a policy
here at work in which they do not allow any sql select statements with
a wildcard, i.e. "select * from ...". I have tried escaping the
wildcard but it makes no difference, even on opengrok's own search
site. Can someone point me in the right direction?

Regards

to me, opengrok-discu. 
It can very well be, we don't even index a wildcard
it depends on language analyzer

e.g. sql analyzer inherits tokenizer from plain file analyzer
which says(regexp):
Identifier = [a-zA-Z_] [a-zA-Z0-9_]*

hence I doubt '*' is indexed

obviously these analyzers could be improved, so it's just about adjusting the appropriate .lex file and improve the lexical analysis
also note that 1 char tokens most usually don't make that much sense and just unnecessary increase index, so we do them only for full search, I think symbols and refs just ignore 1 char identifiers ...

Yes, that makes sense as "select \?" also did not work. I found a post
on a lucene mailing list that said there was a failure in query
parsing to discover regex expressions and redirect to the proper
analyzer, so they are aware of it (I think a patch was written). Also,
I really just want to be a user right now, and not have to write my
own Analyzer. Thank for the reply.

to me 
Well I can try to relax this and add more chars besides a-zA-Z0-9 to the indentifier
albeit I will not do it before release of 0.11 (too risky)

I have already an upgrade to lucene 3.5 prepared
so I can try to check such relaxation after I push that upgrade (newer lucene has less memory consumption + faster searching).

I hope the index will not grow that big and the search will still be fast enough - if yes, I will gladly relax the indentifier regexp

If you have time, please file it as a bug to http://defect.opensolaris.org/
I'll pick up so I don't forget about this bug

thnx
