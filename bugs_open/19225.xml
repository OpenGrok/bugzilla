            <thetext>The AccuRev support seems to have several problems:

Biggest one IMHO is the AccuRevRepository:isRepositoryFor(...), which forks an accurev process for each file to be tested. For auto repo detection (which is probably used by most users) this may have a really bad impact (no matter, whether there is actually a accrev repo or not), since the scanner walks down the source root tree ... So if AccuRev is installed, but one doesn&apos;t have AccuRev, for now it is probably the best to set the JVM property org.opensolaris.opengrok.history.AccuRev to an invalid path so that isWorking() always returns false and doesn&apos;t try it again and again (add README note?) ...

Also several times there are exceptions declared, which are actually not thrown (e.g. AccuRevRepository:annotate) -&gt; sounds supicious ...

Last but not least: AccuRevHistoryParser:processStream doesn&apos;t do, what&apos;s documented above its while loop. Probably an import/auto-format problem ...</thetext>
